Hi there!

<p>I am extreamly excited to share that today I have cleared the 3rd fundamental certification of Azure, ie AI900-Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals.</p>

# Getting the Fundamentals Cleared:
<p>
For most of Azure Associate level certificaiton, there main 3 pre-requists, AZ900, DP900, AI900.
The Certifications are required if you are planning to take any Associate or Expert level path for Azure.
</p>

## My Experience of Clearing the Fundamentals:

### Experience of Clearing AI900:
<p>
AI900 is a certification exam of 90 mins. The exam process is simillar to all other Azure certifications.
Below is the process in short:
<ul>
<li>Register for the exam.</li>
<li>Test Your System</li>
<li>Checkin 30 mins prior to exam, get your id verified and there you go...give your exam!</li>
</ul>
<br>
The exam tests your basic knowledge of AI along various Azure AI solutions. Below are the topic wise weightage of the exam:
The content of this exam was updated on January 27, 2021. Please download the exam skills outline below to see what changed.
<ul>
<li>Describe AI workloads and considerations (15-20%)</li>
<li>Describe fundamental principles of machine learning on Azure (30-35%)</li>
<li>Describe features of computer vision workloads on Azure (15-20%)</li>
<li>Describe features of Natural Language Processing (NLP) workloads on Azure (15-20%)</li>
<li>Describe features of conversational AI workloads on Azure (15-20%)</li>
</ul>
</p>

### The Preprations:
<p>
I generally prefer the MS Docs for the related content. 
</p>
You can find the docs [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/ai-900).

<p>
T prepare for the exam, docs provide all the topics in 1 place. Once you are comfortable with the docs, you can try some mock assessments at Udemy, which provides some great source to get some insights on how will the questions be in the real exam.
</p>

> Hope that this will help you for preparing the the certifications!
