Hi there!

<p>Happy Happy New Year 2021</p>

<p>2020 was the toughest year for humanity in-deed. Everyone has suffered in some way or the other. Everyone will remember this year for some reason. I have my reasons too. But lets recall only the positives this evening.</p>

<p>Being optimistic about 2020, I would like to remember 2020 as the year in which I met some people that are very close to me now. I made some great friends for life. Got time to spend with family.</p>

<p>Everyone will agree on this:</p>

> No one had thought that they would get this much of time to spend with their families at home. Many of my seniors and I had not thought that we would get this much time with family after starting a professional career. That's the biggest positive from this year I can think of.

Let me know yours, will be glad to know.

Signing-off for 2020!

Lets catch-up in the next post, next year.

Till then, bbye O/
