Hi there!

<p>Happy Happy New Year 2021</p>

<p>2020 was the toughest year for humanity in-deed. Everyone has suffered in some way or other. Everyone will remember this year for some reason. I have my reasons too.</p>

<p>Being optimistic about 2020, I would like to remember 2020 as the year in which I met some people that are very close to me now. I made some great friends for life. Got time to spend with family.</p>

<p>Everyone will agree on this:</p>

> No one had thaught that they would get this much of time to specd with their families at home if this would have not happened. Many of my senoirs and I have not thaught that we would get this much time with family after start a professional career. That the biggest positive I can think of.

Let me know yours, will be glad to know.

Sign-off for 2020!

Lets catch-up in the next post, next year.

Till then, bbye O/
