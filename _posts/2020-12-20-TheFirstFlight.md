Hi there!

<p>Finally, today I have cleared the AZ900-Azure Fundamentals Certification.</p>

### AZ900-Microsoft Azure Fundamentals

<p>This exam is for beginners like me who are starting to explore what the cloud is and how the stuff works over there. Below is the high-level syllabus of the exam as of Dec 2020:
<ul>
<li>Describe cloud concepts (20-25%)</li>
<li>Describe core Azure services (15-20%)</li>
<li>Describe core solutions and management tools on Azure (10-15%)</li>
<li>Describe general security and network security features (10-15%)</li>
<li>Describe identity, governance, privacy, and compliance features (20-25%)</li>
<li>Describe Azure cost management and Service Level Agreements (10-15%)</li>
</ul>
</p>

[Here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900) are the complete details about the same.

### The Exam Process:

<p>I scheduled my exam for Dec 20,2020 with Pearson VUE. The exam duration is 90 minutes. But if you are giving it online, like me, you have to check-in atleast 30 minutes prior to the exam appointment. So I scheduled my exam for Dec 20. Yes I am mentioning this again, I know ðŸ˜†.

I had an appointment for 5.15 PM IST for the exam. I checked-in at around 4.45 PM IST. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Pearson Vue has slightly changed the overall process. Below is the check-in process:
<ul>
<li>Once you register for any AZ certification, you recieve a confirmation mail with all the details.</li>
<li>In that mail, there is a link to Test Your System. Ensure to do that before exam day.</li>
<li>On the exam day, Click on the Check-in link mentioned in the confirmation mail to launch check-in window.</li>
<li>Download the OnVue Utility for Exam.</li>
<li>Capture images of yourself, your identity proof and your surroundings and proceed further. You can use your laptop camera or moblie camera to do that.</li>
<li>On submitting all the images, it will start a call with the Pearson agent who will verify your identity and other images and ask you to show your surroundings.</li>
<li>On verifying the details, they will release the exam for you and disconnect the call. However, your recording will be ON all the time and you can communicate with them through the chat window.</li>
<li>Make sure to sit an isolated room, uninterrupted during the exam.</li>
</ul>
</p>

### My Exam Exprerience:
<p>Since I was appearing for such exam for the first time, I learnt some lessons. I hope these will be helpful for anyone who is planning to appear for any AZ certification.
</p>

<p><ol>
<li> Checkin atleast 30 mins before exam since that process takes time.</li>
<li> My Wifi stopped working mid of the exam. So I had to connect my system with my mobile hotspot. You can keep your mobile hotspot ON in case your main connection goes down. The system will automatically connects to the secondary network in that case.</li>
<li> If your network sucks during the exam, <strong>don't panic</strong>. The exam gets paused sometime after getting disconnected from the network. You can start from where you left. Your time also pauses if you faces any network issue. But make sure to have backup, because I am not sure how much time it gives before disconnecting us.</li>
<li> Make sure to capture clear pictures of your identity proof. They can ask you to re-do the entire check-in process if they find the image is not clear. This is what happened with me.</li>
<li> During the exam, it asks for your expertee in each topic. You can rate yourself accordingly. The main point here is, The Higher you rate yourself, more difficult will be the questions in the exam.</li>
</ol></p>

<p>After the check-in process, I got 37 questions total out of which I had to correctly answer atleast as many questions so that I get more than 700 points out of a total of 1000 points. Yeah! I was able to do so.  </p>

### The Preparation:

<p>The resource materials provided by Microsoft are sufficient for the preparation. Also there are many resources available online that gives an idea on how the questions will be like in the actual exam. There are many preparatory courses on Udemy as well.</p> 

I referred the [MS Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900) majorly for my preparation.

Hope you find this information useful.
