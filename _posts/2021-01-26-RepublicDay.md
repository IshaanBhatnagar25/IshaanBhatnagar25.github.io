Hi there!

<p>On this Republic Day,2021, I have cleared the DP900 Azure Data Fundamentals Certification.
This exam is a certification exam for testing various techniques of working with data. It covers topics like ETL,ELT, Data Cleaning, Data Engineering and many more. It also tests the knowledge of various Azure Tools to deal with data.
</p>

## Exam Experience:
<p>The exam is of 90 mins duration where it follows the standard process of check-in followed by room inspection and then the exam. If your checkin is colpleted bwfore time, you can request the invigilator to release your exam before time as well. The exam is of 60 mins during which I got around 40 question. Most of them were MCQs based on senarios.
</p>

## Prepration:
<p>MS Docs are the best way to prepare for the exam. Also the mock tests available online helps to gain an idea of questions that are generally asked in the exam.
Below are the topics which are asked in the exam:
<ul>
<li>Describe core data concepts (15-20%)</li>
<li>Describe how to work with relational data on Azure (25-30%)</li>
<li>Describe how to work with non-relational data on Azure (25-30%)</li>
<li>Describe an analytics workload on Azure (25-30%)</li>
</ul>
</p>

> Hope that this will help you if you are preprating for these certifications!
