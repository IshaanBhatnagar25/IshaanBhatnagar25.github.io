Hey there! 
<p>
So I have decided to come up with a Blogpost-based Portfolio. 
Being the first blogpost of mine, I am really confused about what to write and how to write. ðŸ˜…
</p>

<p>
So lets get to the backgroud first.
I was looking to make a portfolio of mine. After checking out my great portfolios, it got really confusing. ðŸ˜† <br>
Some of the portfolios actually gave me the kick to make something of mine.
</p>

### So the Portfolio
<p>
Finally I decided, I want something simple that will actually convey what I am up to.
M planning to stuff that I am doing or I wanna do. Thats the plan ðŸ˜†.
</p>
I have created this portfolio using <strong>Jekyll. </strong>
>Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites. Written in Ruby by Tom Preston-Werner, GitHub's co-founder, it is distributed under the open source MIT license.

### Fun fact of the day:
While using the terminal, you must have used a: <code>foo@user:~ $ls</code>

And I am pretty sure that you might have written $sl instead of $ls command
```console
foo@user:~ $sl
```
So for the next time, before running a $sl, just install this amazing package 'sl'
```console
foo@user:~ $sudo apt-get install sl
```
Now run a 
```console
foo@user:~ $sl
```
<p>
Let me know what you get in the shell window in the comments section.
You will be amazed for sure!
</p>
<p>Lets catch up in the next post.</p>
<p>Till then O/</p>
