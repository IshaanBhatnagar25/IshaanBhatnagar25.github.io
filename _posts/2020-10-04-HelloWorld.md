Hey there! 
So if you are a final year student or a professional, you must have heard this term *Portfolio*.
So what is it?
Is it really that important?

>Portfolios are a great way to demonstrate the competencies you would list on a resume or talk about in an interview â€” they allow you to show and not just tell. During a job search, the portfolio showcases your work to potential employers. It presents evidence of your relevant skills and abilities. 

Thats a snippet from one of the [blog post](https://www.capella.edu/blogs/cublog/why-a-portfolio-is-important-for-your-career/) of Capella University. Have a look at the complete post! Its really insightful.

So I finally found this amazing theam *Lanyon*.
