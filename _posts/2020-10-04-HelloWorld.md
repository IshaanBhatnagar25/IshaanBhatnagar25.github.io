Hey there! &nbsp;
<p>
So finally I have decided to come up with a Blogpost-based Portfolio. &nbsp;
Being the first blogpost of mine, I am really confused about what to write and how to write.ðŸ˜‰
&nbsp;
So lets get to the backgroud first.
I was looking to make a portfolio of mine. After checking out my great portfolios, it got really confusing. ðŸ˜† 
Some of the portfolios actually gave me the kick to make something of mine.

### So my Portfolio
Finally I decided, I want something simple that will actually convey what I am up to.
M planning to stuff that I am doing or I wanna do. Thats the plan ðŸ˜†.

I have created this portfolio using Jekyll. 
>Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites. Written in Ruby by Tom Preston-Werner, GitHub's co-founder, it is distributed under the open source MIT license.

Checkout their website [here](https://jekyllrb.com/)

### Fun fact of the day:
While using the terminal, you must have used:
```console
foo@user:~ $ls
```

And I am pretty sure that you might have written $sl instead of $ls command
```console
foo@user:~ $sl
```
So for the next time, before running a $sl, just install this amazing package 'sl'
```console
foo@user:~ $sudo apt-get install sl
```
No run a 
```console
foo@user:~ $sl
```

Let me know what you get in the shell window in the comments section.  &nbsp;
You will be amazed!&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Lets catch up in the next post.&nbsp;
Till then O/
